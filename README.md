# FuelConsumption

In order to learn iOS development I have decided to remake old assignments from the first time I learned programming. The purpose of this assignment was to calculate the rate of consumption, in the form of litres per 100 km, given the number of km travelled by a car travelled by a distance as user input.

This application is represented graphically with the help of a UIScrollView and has been created with different screens in mind. Results are updated as text fields are updated.
